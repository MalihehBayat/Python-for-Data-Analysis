### About Movielens Dataset:
GroupLens Research (http://www.grouplens.org/node/73) provides a number of collections of movie ratings data collected from users of MovieLens in the late 1990s and
early 2000s. The data provide movie ratings, movie metadata (genres and year), and demographic data about the users (age, zip code, gender, and occupation). Such data
is often of interest in the development of recommendation systems based on machine learning algorithms.
The MovieLens 1M data set contains 1 million ratings collected from 6000 users on 4000 movies. Itâ€™s spread across 3 tables: ratings, user information, and movie information.
