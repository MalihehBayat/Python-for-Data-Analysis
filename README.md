# Python-for-Data-Analysis
Practicing the examples in the book: Python for Data Analysis
I like to read data science books and practice the materials. 
All the practices and data sets in this project are from "Python for Data Analysis" writen by Wes McKinney: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781449323592/
