# Python-for-Data-Analysis
Practicing the examples in the book: Python for Data Analysis writen by Wes McKinney: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781449323592/
All the practices and data sets in this project are based on the book, but in many cases I have used my own approaches to solve the problems.

**Each folder contains a different data set and its analysis using python/ jupyter notebook)
