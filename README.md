# Python-for-Data-Analysis
### Practicing the examples in the book: Python for Data Analysis 
writen by Wes McKinney: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781449323592/


All the practices and data sets in this project are based on the book, but in many cases I have used my own approaches to solve the problems.

<b>Each folder contains a different data set and its analysis using python/ jupyter notebook </b>
